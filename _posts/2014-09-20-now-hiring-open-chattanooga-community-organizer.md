## FAQ

### What would an example of daily tasks be?

A typical day may find you reaching out to local partner organizations, attending a local tech meet up or brainstorming on venues for an upcoming unconference. At its heart this is an organizing job with the purpose of building an engaged Open Chattanooga Brigade.

### Would there be a group of people working with this position?

You may wish to work directly on-site with Sean on the 4th Floor, but it is not strictly necessary. As long as you are in Chattanooga or close by, you may work remotely. You will be directly interfacing with the community.

### How soon are you looking for this person to start and when would the position end? (I think I saw that it was temporary).

It is indeed temporary. It would end three months from the start date..

### Is this a 9 to 5 restricted to the 4th Floor?

No. You are free to work remotely as long as you are in Chattanooga or close by.

### How did the 3-month grant come about?

We have had these funds through a Knight Foundation grant since the beginning of the year. Because ramping up our community organizing effort appears to be crucial, we decided to take advantage of the funding we have left available. You can read more about our grant here: https://trello.com/c/7TQmKEw3/32-knight-application

### Does the paid position conflict with the volunteer nature of the Brigade?

We don't think so. It's meant to temporarily augment our volunteer effort to make the Open Chattanooga brigade more effective.

### When will interviews for Community Organizer start and when will the position be filled?

We will start interviewing the week of October 6th. The organizer will start immediately after hire.

### Is preference given to folks who live in Chattanooga?

You must be able to interface directly with the community, so you must be willing to move to Chattanooga if you are not here already. We will not give re-location assistance.

### Is there a possibility for long-term employment after the 3-month grant?

There is no possibility for long-term employment.
